# lean.js
An example of using Lean's backend API to implement a new language backend.

Currently you need my unmerged branch of [Lean](https://github.com/jroesch/lean/tree/direct-calls) to build this backend.

I still need to improve the output method, currently this just dumps all the code to standard output.
